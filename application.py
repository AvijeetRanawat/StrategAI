Manchester City FC owns Y < 0 area throughout the game and tries to goal in the goal post near Y = 4.4. Utilizing player statistics and history from FBRef for both teams, the strategist provides only an output JSON file with optimized positions for all 11 Manchester City FC players, ensuring the suggestions are realistic and achievable within the next minute.
